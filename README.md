# Quality of Life bash scripts

These are just some bash scripts I wrote for myself to make my life a bit easier. I also decided to write them in bash as a challenge and to learn more about bash.

You can use the scripts as well if you want.

Perhaps I'll be adding some more here soon.

Current list of scripts and what they do:

- toggletouchpad.sh - Toggles the touchpad (Currently only supports GNOME! Support for more DE's/WM's coming very soon!)
- vpnmanager.sh - A CLI manager for VPNs.
